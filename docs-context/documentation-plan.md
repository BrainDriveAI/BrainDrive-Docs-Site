# Documentation Plan

## Persona

**Adam Carter (Builder/Owner/Entrepreneur)**

## Goal

Empower BrainDrive Builders to bring their AI-powered vision to life as quickly and efficiently as possible.

## How We Do It

- Build understanding of—and excitement for—the overall system fast.
- Make the right docs discoverable at the exact right moment.
- Provide up-to-date, easy-to-follow training (step-by-step and use-case specific).
- Offer fast, detailed support from us and the community.

## Where We Do It

- **System understanding & training:** Docusaurus (<https://braindriveai.github.io/BrainDrive-Docs/>)
- **Code & technical specs:** GitHub repositories
- **Builder support & community:** Discourse (<https://community.braindrive.ai>)

## System Understanding / Excitement / Training — Docusaurus

BrainDrive is a modular, plugin-based system. The code lives in multiple repositories: one for the core (front end and back end) and many for plugins. That can be confusing for new Builders, so Docusaurus is the single starting point where Builders can:

- Understand what BrainDrive is and how the pieces fit together
- Get excited about using BrainDrive to ship their ideas
- Find the tools and training to move fast

The homepage gives a snapshot of the components and how they connect. Each component links to a deep-dive page with quick starts, guides, and training to help Builders start building right away.

## System Technical Specifications — GitHub

When Builders are ready to build, they should find clean, well-documented code.

- Repo docs stay code-focused and repo-specific (APIs, specs, examples).
- High-level concepts and training live in Docusaurus and link into the relevant repos.
- Repo technical docs link back to Docusaurus for overviews and in-depth guides. This keeps code docs lean while making navigation between “what & why” (Docusaurus) and “how” (GitHub) effortless.

## Builder Support & Community — Discourse

As Builders begin building, they need responsive support and a place to collaborate.

- community.braindrive.ai is where Builders get help from maintainers and connect with other Owners/Builders.
- Every docs page and relevant repo doc links to a matching forum thread for live discussion and Q&A.
- Forum posts link back to the specific Docusaurus or GitHub docs referenced, keeping conversations anchored to the source.
