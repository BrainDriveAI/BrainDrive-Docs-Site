# Privacy Focused Pat Persona

## Snapshot

* **Who:** Tech-curious professional (analyst, creator, consultant, educator, SMB owner, engineer-adjacent). **Not necessarily a developer but fearless with new tools.**
* **Comes for:** **Privacy & ownership** (local, no data exhaust).
* **Stays for:** Practical **use cases** now; clear path to **modify, extend, and eventually monetize** their BrainDrive.
* **Devices:** Desktop/laptop first; happy to access from phone while the machine is on.
* **Magic moment:** “It runs locally, answers questions about **my files** with **citations**, and I can tweak how it works.”

---

## Demographics (lightweight)

* **Age:** 28–50 | **Regions:** N. America & Europe (global interest)
* **Education:** College-educated professional, often self-taught with tech
* **Income:** $50k–$120k; cost-conscious about recurring SaaS

---

## Mindset & Narrative

**Privacy → Ownership → Extensibility → Monetization (optional).**
Pat believes tools should be inspectable, portable, and improvable. AI (and good scaffolding) lowers the bar—Pat expects to tinker now and may build/sell later.

---

## Jobs To Be Done (ranked)

1. **Run AI privately** on my own hardware; no surprise network calls.
2. **Ask questions about my documents** and get reliable answers with **citations**.
3. **Control models**: start fast with Local OLLAMA, Use API based models later once he understands privacy tradeoffs and management.
4. **Capture & reuse**: turn sessions into **Personas** and **Knowledge Packs**.
5. **Peek under the hood**: see settings, logs, and “how this works” without diving into code.
6. **Learn to extend**: install a connector (MCP), tweak prompts/flows, try a simple plugin.
7. **Publish/monetize** (optional): share or sell a persona/pack/plugin when it’s useful.

## Key Characteristics

### 1) Privacy-First

* Values **data sovereignty**; distrusts Big Tech data practices.
* Has paused putting sensitive docs into hosted AIs.
* Uses privacy tools (password managers, encrypted messaging).

> “I want the power of AI **without giving away** my data.”

### 2) Practical Use-Case Seeker

* Wants help with writing/research, decisions, planning, **life coaching & goals**, finance, fitness, content creation, learning.
* Prefers **clear value** over jargon or features-for-features’ sake.

> “I don’t need internals—just an AI coach that knows my goals and keeps them **private**.”

### 3) “Magical Local AI” Discoverer

* New to local models; blown away by **offline** chat that actually works.

> “Wait, I can run an AI **on my laptop**, offline, and it works? That’s wild.”

### 4) Potential Builder (Eventually)

* Not a coder, but intrigued by **personas**, **prompt chains**, and **plugins**.
* Likes knowing there’s a path to **sell** something later—even if they never do.

> “I could package my workflow for my niche and share or sell it.”

## Motivations & Frustrations

**Beliefs:** Privacy is a right; ownership matters; simplicity should be powerful; AI should empower individuals.
**Goals:** Private AI use; real-world outcomes; fewer subscriptions; unified data/context; learn enough to extend; optional path to earn.
**Frustrations:** SaaS lock-in; siloed data; unclear training policies; subscription fatigue; CLI/setup pain; “RAG mush” (no proof docs were used); limited customization.

---

## Decision Criteria

1. **Privacy & control:** offline mode; per-persona egress policy; visible network indicator; telemetry off by default.
2. **TTFGA** (Time To First Grounded Answer): install → upload → cited answer **in minutes**.
3. **Extensibility path:** obvious steps to tweak/install/build (docs, examples, “open the hood”).
4. **Model pragmatism:** sensible defaults with easy switching.
5. **Portability & commerce:** export/import personas/packs; optional marketplace path.

---

## Messaging That Lands

* **“Your AI, your machine.”** No account required; offline-first option.
* **“Upload → answer with citations.”** Trust what it used.
* **“Tweak anything over time.”** Start simple; open the hood when ready.
* **“Own it today. Build on it tomorrow.”** Share or sell if/when you want.

**Anti-messages:** buzzwords, cutesy characters, vague privacy claims, locked templates, forced SaaS.

---

## First-Run Experience (happy path)

1. **Install** (signed, no-terminal).
2. Welcome with **Privacy defaults ON** (offline-only by default).
3. **Model choice:** “Download local starter (guided Ollama + progress), add API based models via Open Router if desired”
4. **Drop a file** → ask: “Summarize with 5 bullets + **citations**” (citations panel auto-opens).
5. **CTA:** “Create Persona from this chat” → name it → pin it.
6. **Curiosity fork:** “Show internals” reveals chunking, citation sources, persona JSON, file locations.

---

## Learning Tracks (in-app)

* **Owner → Tinkerer (15–30 min):** edit persona prompt; attach a Knowledge Pack; switch models per chat.
* **Tinkerer → Builder (30-60 min):** install a connector (MCP), add a small UI action, export/import persona JSON.
* **Builder → Entrepreneur (half day):** package persona/pack/plugin with metadata; publish to community/market.

---

## Product Requirements (Pat-MVP)

* **Installers** (Win → macOS → Linux), no-terminal onboarding.
* **Privacy controls:** offline-only; per-persona network policy; visible network indicator; telemetry off by default.
* **Model control:** API quick start + guided **Ollama** download (task manager with progress).
* **Chat with Documents:** drag-and-drop; file status; **citations**; explain limits & fallbacks.
* **Personas & Knowledge Packs:** one-click creation; editable JSON view; export/import.
* **Debug Info** button (one-click, human-readable bundle).

**Near-term enhancements:** Template Gallery (Summarize/Extract/Compare/Find-Your-Why), MCP connectors, Knowledge Pack versioning, provenance badges, marketplace preview.

---

## Journey

* **Discovery:** searches “private/local AI,” privacy forums, YouTube tutorials, “Run ChatGPT locally” blog posts; word-of-mouth.
* **Initial engagement:** installs; has two “wow” moments—**offline chat** then **chat with docs + citations**; tries a few personas.
* **Active use:** daily writing/research/brainstorming; creates personas; uploads docs; advocates for private AI.
* **Growth:** completes “Find Your Why” flow; considers packaging a niche persona/pack; explores Studio + marketplace.

---

## Example Use Cases

1. **Private Work Assistant:** draft emails, prep decks, Q&A over internal docs—never leaves device.
2. **Personal Life Coach:** “Find Your Why,” goal setting, weekly check-ins via a dedicated persona.
3. **Content Partner:** brainstorm → draft → edit privately; keep a brand voice persona.
4. **Learning Companion:** explainers, quizzes, tracked progress via a learning persona.
5. **Decision Tool:** structured pros/cons, assumptions, and risks—all grounded in Pat’s docs.

---

## Channels & Proof

* **Search:** “private AI,” “local AI,” “AI no data collection”
* **YouTube:** short install → first-answer → persona videos
* **Communities:** r/privacy, r/selfhosted, r/LocalLLaMA; privacy forums
* **Professional:** LinkedIn content on privacy/productivity; podcast spots; tech blogs

---

## Success Metrics (Pat)

* % chats in **offline/restricted-egress** modes.
* Persona **creation & edit rate** after week 1.
* **Export/import** usage; knowledge pack adoption.
* **Creator conversion:** % publishing something (free/paid) within 60–90 days.
* **Managed hosting** uptake (private instance SKU).
