**Our Mission:** Build a superior user-owned alternative to Big Tech AI Platforms. An alternative build on the following 4 pillars:

1\. Ownership 

2\. Freedom 

3\. Empowerment 

4\. Sustainability 

Serving three key constituencies. 

**1\. BrainDrive Owners** 

There are no BrainDrive "users" \- only owners. 

Your AI system belongs to you, not Big Tech. 

As a BrainDrive owner: 

● **You own** your AI system, data, and innovations—with no lock-ins or hidden restrictions ● **You control** how your AI operates, where it's hosted, and which models you use ● **You benefit** fully from what you create, with no corporate interference 

Ownership isn't just a feature. It's the foundation of our entire community. **2\. BrainDrive Builders** 

Are you a developer, a tinkerer, or someone with a vision for what AI could be? Then you’re a BrainDrive Builder. 

And you don’t need anyone’s permission to start building: 

● Build for yourself 

● Build for other BrainDrive owners 

● Build for the entire BrainDrive community 

The only limit is your imagination. 

Your BrainDrive, your rules. 

3\. BrainDrive Entrepreneurs 

If you make money with your BrainDrive (or hope to) then you’re a BrainDrive Entrepreneur.  
BrainDrive Entrepreneurs create value by: 

● Building and selling AI tools 

● Offering AI-powered services 

● Automating business workflows 

● Creating and monetizing content 

● Developing custom solutions 

● Trading knowledge and capabilities 

BrainDrive means the freedom to: 

● Build whatever you want, however you want 

● Distribute wherever you want 

● Keep the value you create 

● Set your own terms 

● Build Direct relationships with your customers 

And it means freedom from: 

● Ecosystem lock-in 

● Opaque and oppressive app store rules 

● Outrageous app store fees 

This isn't just about building a business, it's about having true independence in how you create and capture value in the new economy. 

Join Us 

Soon, we will rely on AI systems in all areas of our lives. 

Who owns those systems will define our future: 

● **Corporate AI ownership** \= exploitation and loss of freedom 

● **Personal AI ownership** \= individual freedom and empowerment 

Which road we take will be the defining question of our time. 

Join us on the road away from Big Tech exploitation and towards individual freedom and empowerment.
