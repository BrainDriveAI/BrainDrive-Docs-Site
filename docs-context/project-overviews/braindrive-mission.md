Our mission is to build a superior **user-owned** alternative to Big Tech AI systems. 

A user-owned AI system built on the following pillars:

1. **Ownership** \- You own your AI system.  
2. **Freedom** \- Your AI system is not restricted  
3. **Empowerment** \- Your AI system is easy to use, customize, and build on.  
4. **Sustainability** \- Your AI system is financed via value creation, not platform lock-in.

## Why this mission?

We lost control of our digital data and knowledge to Big Tech in the last phase of the internet, and they've used that control to:

* Share our data without our permission  
* Earn hundreds of billions by selling our data to advertisers  
* Suppress free speech

Big Tech AI platforms like ChatGPT are putting this trend on steroids.

**If we continue using Big Tech platforms it will mean:**

* **Less Privacy** \- They will control our digital data and knowledge  
* **Less Freedom** \- They will decide what we can and cannot do with AI  
* **Less Wealth** \- They will be the primary beneficiaries of AI wealth creation

**If we use an AI platform we own and control it will mean:**

* **More Privacy** \- We will control our digital data and knowledge  
* **More Freedom** \- We will decide what we do with AI  
* **More Wealth** \- We will be the primary beneficiaries of AI wealth creation

## How we do it

To build a superior user-owned alternative to Big Tech AI systems, we need:

**1\) An Open, User-Owned Foundation**

A foundation that provides user ownership and control over the five primary components of any AI system:

1. **The interface** \- How you interact with your AI system  
2. **The memory** \- Your conversation history and how it's stored and retrieved  
3. **The intelligence** \- The AI models you use  
4. **The hosting** \- Where your AI system lives  
5. **The connections** \- How your AI system connects with other systems and tools

This foundation must be permissionless and easy to build on.

**2\) Open, Community-Driven Innovation**

Once we own the foundation, we can build an open community on top of that open foundation. An open community that drives innovation for ourselves, instead of for Big Tech companies.

Big Tech is huge, but there's far more capital and talent outside Big Tech than within it. Individuals will be far more motivated to build, innovate, and connect on a platform they own and control. This will allow us to drive more innovation and as a result a superior, open alternative to Big Tech’s closed AI systems. 

**3\) Open, Free Market Economy**

Big Tech isn't competing in the free market. They've captured the digital economy by building a network effect on their closed platforms.

An open, user-owned foundation and community are the key to unlocking the door to these closed platforms. Once open, capital and talent will flow from Big Tech's extractive systems to ones where creators capture the value they generate.

## How BrainDrive Fits

We're not starting from 0 in this fight.

The open source community is making real progress across all the components needed for a superior user-owned alternative to Big Tech AI systems. 

It's just that no one has brought it all together in a manner that is easy for the average person to use, customize, and build on. 

That's what BrainDrive is working to do.

To make it easy for anyone to build, control, and benefit from their own AI system. And to participate along with the rest of the open source community in building a superior, open alternative to Big Tech’s closed systems.

## Progress 

We’re not starting from 0 in this fight. 

The open source community is making much progress in the 5 components. 

It’s just that no one has brought it all together yet. 

That’s what BrainDrive is trying to do. 

## **How BrainDrive Fits**

BrainDrive is the open-source ChatGPT alternative you fully own and control. Use local or API models, customize via plugins, and monetize on your terms—no Big Tech overlords.

## **Join Us**

* Install the core and take your first local chat from “hello” to “useful.”

* Build or fork a plugin and share it with the community.

* Contribute to the docs, examples, and roadmap as we move through the phases.

**Your AI. Your Rules.**

To build a superior user-owned alternative to Big Tech AI system we need:

1. A user owned foundation that allows ownership and control over the primary components of an AI platform and that is easy to use, customize and build on.  
2. An open community \-   
3. An open economy that drives revenue in a sustainable mission aligned manner. 

My progress has already been made:

We believe it is not only possible to build a superior user owned alternative to Big Tech AI systems, but the open source community is already well on the way to doing so.
