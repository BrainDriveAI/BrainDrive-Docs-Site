Our mission is to build a superior user-owned alternative to Big Tech AI Platforms. A user-owned platform built on the following 4 pillars:

Pillar 1: Ownership 

With most software, you’re just a **user**. 

With BrainDrive, you’re the **owner**. 

You own your BrainDrive, not us. 

And it’s not just a promise. BrainDrive’s MIT License guarantees it. 

Pillar 2: Freedom 

BrainDrive isn’t just open-source. It’s **free** to use however you please. 

● **Free to use** – No cost to download, install, or run on your own hardware. ● **Free to modify** – Customize, extend, and adapt it to your needs. 

● **Free to distribute** – Share, fork, build, and monetize on BrainDrive without restrictions. ● **Free from lock-ins** – Host anywhere, exit anytime, and take your data with you. 

True ownership means true freedom. BrainDrive ensures both. 

Pillar 3: Empowerment 

We believe AI should **empower everyone,** not concentrate power in the hands of a few. That’s why we’re building an ecosystem where we can all thrive **without gatekeepers.** And that’s why BrainDrive should always be: 

● Simple to set up, customize, and build on. 

● A thriving network built and controlled by its participants 

● Always evolving with the latest technology. 

● Up-to-date with documentation, training, and support. 

Pillar 4: Sustainability 

Many believe making money means compromising open-source ideals. **We reject that notion.** And we also know that sustainability goes beyond financials. We ensure it through:  
● Driving revenue by adding value, not from restrictions or lock-ins. 

● An open, self-sustaining ecosystem where BrainDrive LLC is one participant, of many. ● Structured leadership and transparent decision-making 

● Simplicity, adaptability, and avoiding bloat in everything we do. 

● Continuous innovation – Always pushing forward, never settling. 

Sustainability means BrainDrive doesn’t just survive, it remains the best option for those who want to build, control, and benefit from their own AI system. 

Join Us 

Soon, we will rely on AI systems in all areas of our lives. 

Who owns those systems will define our future: 

● **Corporate AI ownership** \= exploitation and loss of freedom 

● **Personal AI ownership** \= individual freedom and empowerment 

Which road we take will be the defining question of our time. 

Join us on the road away from Big Tech exploitation and towards individual freedom and empowerment.
