# How BrainDrive Plugins Work

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the BrainDrive plugin system. It's designed to help you understand how plugins integrate with BrainDrive, whether you're using an existing plugin or building your own.

## What is a BrainDrive Plugin?

A BrainDrive plugin is a self-contained module that extends BrainDrive's functionality. Plugins can add:

- New UI components for the Page Builder
- AI-powered features and capabilities
- Backend services and data processing
- Integration with external systems
- Custom workflows and automation

The plugin architecture follows a philosophy similar to WordPress for AI: install the BrainDrive core, then add plugins to quickly ship new features.

## Plugin Architecture Overview

BrainDrive uses a modular, plugin-based architecture with two main parts:

### Frontend (UI Components)

- Built with **React 18** and **TypeScript**
- Uses **Webpack Module Federation** to load plugins dynamically at runtime
- Plugins expose UI components that can be dragged onto pages in the Page Builder
- Components are loaded on-demand without requiring a full application reload

### Backend (Server-Side Logic)

- Uses **Python** with **FastAPI**
- Plugins can include optional server-side logic via a **Lifecycle Manager**
- Backend handles plugin installation, configuration, and data persistence
- Provides universal REST API endpoints for plugin management

## Plugin Structure

A typical BrainDrive plugin repository has the following structure:

```
MyPlugin/
├── package.json              # Metadata and dependencies
├── src/                      # Source code (React components)
│   ├── index.tsx            # Main entry point
│   └── components/          # Plugin components
├── dist/                     # Built files
│   └── remoteEntry.js       # Module Federation entry point
├── lifecycle_manager.py      # (Optional) Backend lifecycle manager
├── webpack.config.js         # Build configuration
└── README.md                # Plugin documentation
```

### Key Files

**package.json**
- Defines plugin metadata (name, version, description)
- Lists frontend dependencies
- Includes build scripts

**lifecycle_manager.py**
- Python class implementing plugin lifecycle methods
- Handles installation, removal, and status checks
- Defines what components the plugin provides

**remoteEntry.js**
- Generated by Webpack Module Federation during build
- Exposes plugin modules to the BrainDrive core
- Automatically served by the backend when plugin is installed

## Plugin Lifecycle

### Installation

When a user installs a plugin through the Plugin Manager:

1. **User provides GitHub URL** - The plugin repository URL is entered in the Plugin Manager UI
2. **Backend downloads plugin** - BrainDrive clones or downloads the plugin repository
3. **Lifecycle manager runs** - If present, the plugin's `install_plugin(user_id, db)` method is called
4. **Setup tasks execute** - The plugin can initialize databases, create default settings, etc.
5. **Plugin registered** - The plugin is added to the user's installed plugins list
6. **Frontend updated** - Plugin components become available in the Page Builder

### Usage

Once installed:

- Plugin components appear in the **Page Builder component library**
- Users can drag components onto pages and configure them
- Components use **Service Bridges** to interact with BrainDrive
- Plugin state and data persist across sessions

### Updates

- BrainDrive tracks plugin versions from the repository
- Users can update plugins through the Plugin Manager
- Updates are user-scoped (each user controls their plugin versions)
- Update process follows similar steps to installation

### Removal

When a plugin is uninstalled:

1. **User clicks uninstall** in the Plugin Manager
2. **Lifecycle manager runs** - The `delete_plugin(user_id, db)` method is called
3. **Cleanup occurs** - Plugin removes its data, settings, and files
4. **Plugin unregistered** - Removed from user's installed plugins
5. **Components removed** - No longer available in Page Builder

## Universal Plugin API

BrainDrive provides a standardized REST API for all plugins. These endpoints work automatically for any plugin following the lifecycle interface:

```
POST   /api/plugins/{plugin_slug}/install     # Install plugin
DELETE /api/plugins/{plugin_slug}/uninstall   # Uninstall plugin
GET    /api/plugins/{plugin_slug}/status      # Check if installed
GET    /api/plugins/{plugin_slug}/info        # Get metadata
POST   /api/plugins/{plugin_slug}/repair      # Repair/reinstall
GET    /api/plugins/available                 # List all plugins
```

This universal API means plugin developers don't need to create custom endpoints for basic plugin management.

## Service Bridges

BrainDrive provides six core [service bridges](https://docs.braindrive.ai/core/how-to/use-service-bridges) that plugins use to interact with the system. These services are available via `this.props.services` in React components:

### 1. API Bridge
Make HTTP requests to backend APIs
```typescript
await services.api.get('/some_endpoint')
await services.api.post('/data', { key: 'value' })
```

### 2. Event Bridge
Send and listen for cross-plugin events
```typescript
services.event.emit('eventName', data)
services.event.on('eventName', handler)
```

### 3. Theme Bridge
Access and react to theme changes
```typescript
const theme = services.theme.getCurrentTheme()
services.theme.subscribe(newTheme => {
  // React to theme change
})
```

### 4. Settings Bridge
Get and set user preferences
```typescript
const value = await services.settings.getSetting('myKey')
await services.settings.setSetting('myKey', 'value')
```

### 5. Page Context Bridge
Access current page and route information
```typescript
const context = services.pageContext.getContext()
// Returns: { currentPage, route, params, etc. }
```

### 6. Plugin State Bridge
Persistent key-value storage for your plugin
```typescript
await services.pluginState.save({ myData: 'value' })
const data = await services.pluginState.load()
```

### Why Service Bridges?

Service Bridges provide several benefits:

- **Loose coupling** - Plugins don't depend on core internals
- **Forward compatibility** - Core changes won't break plugins
- **Simplified development** - No need to manage your own database or API
- **Consistent patterns** - All plugins interact with BrainDrive the same way

## Plugin Discovery

BrainDrive automatically discovers plugins in the `backend/plugins/` directory:

```
backend/plugins/
├── shared/           # Plugin files shared across users
│   └── MyPlugin/
│       └── v1.0.0/
│           ├── dist/
│           └── lifecycle_manager.py
└── user_{id}/        # User-specific plugin data
    └── MyPlugin/
        └── data/
```

Plugins are:
- **User-scoped** - Each user has their own set of installed plugins
- **Version-tracked** - Multiple versions can coexist
- **Sandboxed** - User data is isolated from the shared plugin code

## Development Workflow

### Setting Up

1. **Use the Plugin Template** - Start with the official [BrainDrive Plugin Template](https://github.com/BrainDriveAI/BrainDrive-PluginTemplate)
2. **Clone locally** - Clone the template to begin development
3. **Install dependencies** - Run `npm install` to get started
4. **Configure output** - Point build output to BrainDrive's plugin directory

### Rapid Iteration

For fast development (1-minute cycle):

1. **Configure build output** - Set webpack output to `backend/plugins/shared/[YourPlugin]/[version]/dist`
2. **Make changes** - Edit your plugin code
3. **Build** - Run `npm run build`
4. **Refresh** - Reload BrainDrive in browser (disable cache in dev tools)
5. **See changes** - Updates appear immediately without reinstalling

This eliminates the 10+ minute cycle of uninstalling and reinstalling the plugin after each change.

### Testing

- Use the **Page Builder** to add your plugin component to a test page
- Use browser dev tools to debug React components
- Check backend console for lifecycle manager logs
- Use Service Bridges for consistent interaction patterns

## Plugin Manifest

Each plugin defines metadata in its lifecycle manager that tells BrainDrive what the plugin provides:

```python
class MyPluginLifecycleManager:
    def get_plugin_info(self):
        return {
            "name": "My Plugin",
            "slug": "my-plugin",
            "version": "1.0.0",
            "description": "Does something useful",
            "components": [
                {
                    "id": "my-component",
                    "name": "My Component",
                    "category": "widgets"
                }
            ]
        }
```

This information drives:
- Plugin Manager UI
- Page Builder component library
- Component configuration panels
- Plugin documentation

## Multi-User Support

BrainDrive is designed to support multiple users on the same installation:

- **User-scoped installations** - Each user has their own plugin list
- **Shared code** - Plugin code is shared, but data is isolated
- **Independent updates** - Users update plugins independently
- **Permission-based** - Users only see and manage their own plugins

## Best Practices

### For Plugin Developers

1. **Follow the template** - Use the official Plugin Template as your starting point
2. **Use Service Bridges** - Don't bypass them to access core internals
3. **Keep plugins focused** - Each plugin should do one thing well
4. **Document thoroughly** - Include clear README with usage examples
5. **Version properly** - Use semantic versioning and maintain changelog
6. **Test in isolation** - Ensure plugin works independently of others
7. **Handle errors gracefully** - Provide helpful error messages to users

### For Plugin Users

1. **Install from trusted sources** - Only install plugins from known repositories
2. **Keep plugins updated** - Update regularly for bug fixes and features
3. **Monitor performance** - Remove plugins that slow down your system
4. **Report issues** - Help developers improve by reporting bugs
5. **Share feedback** - Let developers know what works and what doesn't

## Security Considerations

- Plugins run with the same permissions as the BrainDrive core
- Only install plugins from sources you trust
- Review plugin code before installing if possible
- Plugin lifecycle managers have database access
- Plugins can make network requests
- BrainDrive provides sandboxing for user data, not plugin code

## Common Patterns

### Creating a Simple Widget

```typescript
import React from 'react';

const MyWidget = ({ services }) => {
  const [data, setData] = React.useState(null);

  React.useEffect(() => {
    // Load plugin state
    services.pluginState.load().then(setData);
  }, []);

  return (
    <div>
      <h2>My Widget</h2>
      <p>{data?.message || 'Hello, World!'}</p>
    </div>
  );
};

export default MyWidget;
```

### Calling an AI Model

```typescript
const response = await services.api.post('/api/chat/completions', {
  messages: [{ role: 'user', content: 'Hello!' }],
  model: 'default'
});
```

### Saving User Settings

```typescript
// Save a setting
await services.settings.setSetting('myPlugin.preference', 'dark');

// Load a setting
const pref = await services.settings.getSetting('myPlugin.preference');
```

### Cross-Plugin Communication

```typescript
// Plugin A emits an event
services.event.emit('dataUpdated', { newValue: 42 });

// Plugin B listens for the event
services.event.on('dataUpdated', (data) => {
  console.log('Data changed:', data.newValue);
});
```

## Troubleshooting

### Plugin Won't Install

- Verify the GitHub URL is correct and accessible
- Check that the repository has a proper build/release
- Look at backend console for error messages during install
- Ensure the plugin structure follows the expected format

### Components Don't Appear

- Verify the plugin is installed (check Plugin Manager)
- Ensure the plugin is enabled for your user
- Check that `remoteEntry.js` exists in the plugin's dist folder
- Look for browser console errors indicating loading issues

### Changes Not Showing

- Disable browser cache in dev tools during development
- Verify both backend and frontend servers are running
- Check that build output is going to the correct directory
- Clear browser cache and hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R)

### Service Bridge Errors

- Verify you're accessing services via `this.props.services`
- Check that the service method exists and is spelled correctly
- Ensure you're awaiting async service calls
- Look for error messages in browser console
