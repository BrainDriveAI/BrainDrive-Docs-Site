# Plugin Developer Quick Start

The canonical quick start guide lives in the BrainDrive-Core repository so it can evolve alongside the code.

📘 [View the latest guide on GitHub](https://github.com/BrainDriveAI/BrainDrive-Core/blob/main/docs/getting-started/plugin-developer-quickstart.md)

We surface the link here to keep existing navigation intact while the upstream documentation is being synced into this site. Once the upstream guide is mirrored locally, this placeholder can be replaced with the full content.
