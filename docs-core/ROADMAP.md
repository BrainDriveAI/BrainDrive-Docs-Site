# **BrainDrive Roadmap**

We’re on a mission to build a superior, **user-owned** alternative to Big Tech AI systems. 

An AI system built on the following 4 pillars:

1. **Ownership** - You should own your AI system.  
2. **Freedom** - Your AI system should not be restricted.  
3. **Empowerment** - Your AI system should be easy to use, customize, & build on.  
4. **Sustainability** - Value should flow to those that create it.

If this resonates, we’d love to build with you.

* Review our 5 Phase roadmap below.
* View BrainDrive’s [developer documentation](/).  
* See open tasks on BrainDrive’s [public github project](https://github.com/orgs/BrainDriveAI/projects/1).
* [Contribute](/core/CONTRIBUTING) by working on open tasks and/or building plugins for yourself and others. 
* Participate in BrainDrive [Dev updates and prioritization discussions](https://community.braindrive.ai/t/braindrive-development-progress-updates/92/33).   
* Join [the BrainDrive community](https://community.braindrive.ai/) for more discussions and weekly email updates. 

## **Roadmap Phases**

## Phase 0: License Selection - (DONE - MIT License Chosen)

**Goal**: Choose the best license for BrainDrive.

**Decision**

The 4 pillars of BrainDrive make the **MIT license** the obvious choice:

1. **Ownership:** Once you install BrainDrive, it's yours forever.
2. **Freedom:** MIT is the most permissive major open source license.
3. **Empowerment:** Build on your BrainDrive without legal uncertainty.
4. **Sustainability:** Value flows to those who create it via services & the plugin layer.

**Why This Matters**

The way to create a superior alternative to Big Tech AI systems, is to do something they never will. Create a completely open alternative to their closed systems.

Why build on a Big Tech owned foundation, when you can build on your own foundation instead?

## Phase 1: Foundation - (CURRENT FOCUS)

**Goal:** BrainDrive owners can easily install BrainDrive-Core on Linux, Windows, and Mac and have a clean first “tell me a joke” chat with a local AI model. 

**Why This Matters:**

Phase 1 is about making it **easy** for anyone to own the foundational components of their AI system.

Your first local, BrainDrive powered chat means you **own** the foundation of your AI system:

1. **Interface** = BrainDrive-Core + AI Chat Plugin  
2. **Intelligence** = Open source AI model  
3. **Memory** = Your conversation history  
4. **Hosting** = Your computer

The chat experience is also built using BrainDrive-Core's plugin-based architecture. It’s the first building block of the many we will create to build a superior, user-owned alternative to Big Tech AI systems. 

**Acceptance Criteria:**

Phase 1 is complete when you can install BrainDrive, reach the chat window, type "tell me a joke," and get a response. Reliably, every time, on any supported platform.

**Key Deliverables:**

* **Installers** 1-click install for Windows, MacOS and Linux
* **Cross-platform installation guide** for developers that works seamlessly on Linux, Windows, and macOS  
* **Ollama integration** with GUI-based model management. Download Ollama and add/remove open source models in BrainDrive, no terminal required.  
* **Default AI Chat plugin** included with BrainDrive-Core install as the first example of a plugin-driven experience

**Where we’re at:**

- **Done:** We have completed the cross-platform installation guide, Ollama Integration, and Default AI chat plugins. Ollama and AI Chat plugin install with BrainDrive-Core by default, and can be easily removed with 1 click.
- **In Progress** 1-click install for Windows, macOS, and Linux

**Community Calls to Action:**

* **Test** [the installation](/core/INSTALL)

**Where we’re at:**

Currently focused on Phases 1 & 2

## **Phase 5: Community Acceleration**

**Goal:** BrainDrive becomes community-driven, accelerating development and innovation beyond what any central team could achieve.

**Why This Matters:**

The open architecture we've built in Phases 1-4 is designed for this moment: when the community's collective creativity and diverse needs drive the platform forward faster than any centralized effort could.

This is where user-owned AI proves its superiority and **sustainability**. Not through a single company's vision, but through thousands of builders creating solutions for their specific needs and sharing them with others.

**Key Focus Areas:**

**Core Development Distribution**

* Community contributors shape core architecture decisions  
* Multiple maintainers beyond the founding team  
* RFC (Request for Comments) process for major changes  
* Transparent governance model for core development

**Advanced Plugin Ecosystem**

* Inter-plugin communication protocols  
* Plugin dependency management  
* Plugin APIs for deeper integration  
* Verified plugin developer program  
* Plugin marketplace with ratings, reviews, and discovery

**Self-Hosted Multi-User Capabilities**

* Team and organization deployment patterns  
* Shared resources and collaborative features  
* Role-based access and permissions  
* Self-hosting best practices and tooling

**Enterprise & Production Readiness**

* SSO and authentication integrations  
* Audit logs and compliance features  
* Backup and migration tools  
* Performance monitoring and optimization  
* Security hardening guides

**Ecosystem Integrations**

* Connect BrainDrive to the broader open source AI ecosystem  
* Integration standards with other user-owned AI projects  
* API standards for third-party service connections  
* Data portability and interoperability protocols

**Sustainable Business Models**

* Monetizable plugin verticals  
* Professional services marketplace  
* Training and certification programs  
* Support tiers for teams and enterprises  
* Sustainable funding models that preserve user ownership

**Sustainability Without Compromise:**

This is where our fourth pillar of Sustainability fully activates. We believe you can build sustainable business models on top of open source software without compromising user ownership or freedom.

BrainDrive-Core remains free, open source, and user-owned forever. Revenue comes from value-added services that people choose to pay for:

* **Premium Plugins** - Developers can charge for specialized plugins while keeping the plugin architecture open  
* **Professional Services** - Training, consulting, custom development for teams and enterprises  
* **Managed Hosting** - Optional hosted solutions for those who want convenience (while self-hosting remains free)  
* **Support Tiers** - Priority support and SLAs for organizations that need them

This model has been proven by projects like WordPress, Linux, and countless other open source ecosystems. Users keep full ownership and control. Developers and service providers can build sustainable businesses. Everyone wins.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

* 10+ active core contributors from outside the founding team  
* 100+ community-maintained plugins  
* 5+ teams/organizations running self-hosted multi-user instances  
* Community-driven feature prioritization process established  
* Sustainable funding model supporting full-time core development  
* Integration partnerships with 3+ major open source AI projects

**Future Community Calls to Action:**

* **Lead specialized working groups** (security, enterprise features, plugin standards, etc.)  
* **Become a core maintainer** and shape the platform's technical direction  
* **Build vertical-specific solutions** (education, healthcare, legal, creative, etc.)  
* **Create integrations** with other open source projects  
* **Develop training programs** and certification curricula  
* **Share case studies** of production deployments  
* **Establish regional communities** and meetups  
* **Contribute to governance** discussions and RFC processes

**What Success Looks Like:**

Development velocity has increased exponentially. Innovation happens at the edges, driven by diverse use cases we never imagined. The platform evolves through community consensus rather than central planning.

Most importantly: thousands of people are building, controlling, and benefiting from their own AI systems. Not ours. Theirs.
